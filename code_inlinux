// Code for save data from signal in LINUX
// Open Terminal in LINUX
// type "rtl_sdr" in terminal line ,then ENTER 
// type "rtl_sdr -f [center frequency] -g [gain to use] -s [sampling rate] -n [number of sampling] [file name].dat"
// for [center frequency] type frequency what you want to save e.g. -f 104500000 [we want to save data from freq 104.5 MHz]
// for [gain to use] type gain what you want  e.g. -g 0 [gain of freq is 0 dB]
// for [sampling rate] type sampling rate what you want to save e.g. -s 1800000 [we want to save data from freq 104.5 MHz by 1800000 Sample/s]
// for [number of sampling] type number of sampling what you want to save e.g. -n 1800000 [we want to save data from freq 104.5 MHz by 1800000 sample]
// and [file name] type name what you want to save e.g. 104p5.dat [mean this file is data of 104.5 MHz ]
for example
we want to save data from 97.5 MHz, gain 0 dB, 1800000 S/s and sample 360000 samples
we typing ...
